- [Testimonial List](https://exercism-testimonials.netlify.app/)

## Design system

I decided to simulate how I would have suggested if I were an employee at [exercism](https://exercism.org/), which is to create a design system for these components to be consumed later.

## Highlights

- Using a design system to consume components
- Keeping pagination and sorting values in query params and reflect from it into the fields on mount
